Project Atlas - S達o Paulo is a Data Science and Engineering initiative to develop Geospatial features about the city of S達o Paulo, Brazil. It congregates several attributes from many public data sources, mostly made available by the [GeoSampa website](http://geosampa.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/PaginasPublicas/_SBC.aspx), a project by the S達o Paulo City Hall. 

A full breakdown of the data sources and their original references can be found below:
